    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>When you're asked to write about yourself, you have so many ideas about what could or should go into that short biography, but none of the good stuff ever actually sees the page.
        Maybe it's better that way.  Personally, I think it's nearly impossible to write about myself, especially in only a few sentences.  But, that doesn't mean it's impossible.  If I 
        Had to start somewhere, it would definitely be with relatable humor, which bring me to two ideas I have accidently or purposefully abided by throughtout my life.
